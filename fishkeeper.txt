The Fish Keeper


some fish live in grand big tanks,
where splendid decorations and bubbles abound
fed heartily each day to stomachs' content
lush plant life, companionship and movement all around

who is this fish keeper

others in more humble homes,
but comfortable for swimming, living
while luxury is not a staple
communities of life thrive, forgiving

who is this fish keeper

less fortunate are those in bowls
water stagnant and neglected
sustenance a fighting battle
lonely pleas silently rejected
...

who is this fish keeper

who is my keeper
