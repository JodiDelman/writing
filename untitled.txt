beauteous sound overtakes, captures
catching attention like flypaper not letting go for anything
lifting, lilting
connected, smooth
picture the world and everyone in it
moving, shifting, living, breathing, crying
everyday living and not stopping
losing perspective
sounds much larger than life whip consciousness
reminding that everyone lives
and breathes and shifts and cries
everyday, neverending
getting lodged in the everyday, the muck, the problems,
the insignificant stressors, the dragging details
all the while the force readies to lift and connect,
always there, always willing to remind 
but not needing to
there for the taking,
revisit often, take care to never lose perspective
the sound will lead back home
above all
your sound will keep you alive,
beating and flowing with life
evident that the sum is larger than life
yet created by none larger than the part
