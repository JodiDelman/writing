A Simple Walk


furry faced companion trotting enthusiastically by my side
in wonderment of every smell, movement, creature on our path
absorbing delights of which we are incapable

scent of jasmine in the warm breeze
passing by like a cloud, intermingled with 
the odors of five different dinners being cooked or served
to the waiting families that are absent from the curiously empty street

lone badly aimed sprinkler darkens the asphalt
my favorite smell, reminding me of afternoon showers
in the place where they could always come, uninvited

dried rose placed on the dash of a beat up truck
signifies a moment and pleads to share its story, as we pass

father and son sit soberly, talking, on the bumper of a car
we pass quietly so as not to disturb

further on, diapered toddler is coached by patient sibling
in the technique of throwing the orange ball into the impossibly high hoop
(of which he has no hope, at least for a couple of years
but still he squats and tries, squats and tries)

fellow canine captures the attention of my furry faced one,
in the rolling expanse of evening-sun-glow green
they strain to make contact, their humans and leashes keeping them in check
click click click click of desperate paws on the sidewalk
but curiosity is deflected as quickly as it was captured (squirrel)

laughing teens pass us, chasing and blushing and teasing, not realizing that 
these are the moments they will remember always,
that will come back to them in the twilight of their long lives
and next year and ten years from this moment
spurred by a scent or a song or a taste

the details, the moments that have passed, building our lives
