musical soft harmless raindrops fill my world each day
i pay them no mind
hoping to avoid disruption of their velvet beauty
voluntarily ignorant of their fickleness, they stay forever
don't move too quickly, they may disperse
it always rains, it means to cleanse the chaos
and make it something new, manageable
day after day i move through the wet mist
turning my eye from the sun
don't look too long, don't look
close your eyes and dance with a quiet step
a moment can expand to years if you let it
when the thunder comes, just hold tight with me
don't look
if you close your eyes just right and call the rain
it will return 
don't think of the sun, don't look
stay with me here and we will smile on the warm pools
and take in the sweet breeze
for as long as it lasts
