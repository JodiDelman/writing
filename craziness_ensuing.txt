Craziness Ensuing

my surroundings are serene and dark
and my body calm and still
yet my mind blasts hot white twisted intertwined thoughts
crashing into one another
darting madly
slithering by and through each other
frantically searching for a place of repose

no rest in sight for the electrified synapses
making my brain buzz in the night
while the rest of the world sleeps,
their demons put to rest at least for awhile

til dawn when they've exhausted themselves
and lie sizzling
still searching
but burnt beyond recognition and spent,
they die.
